# ðŸš€ Serverless Fargate

Adds the ability to maintain long-running Fargate ECS tasks within your Serverless project.

## Overview

Not all behaviour can be broken down and modelled within Lambda's execution duration constraints.
Sometimes you need the ability to exceed this duration, but wish to remain in a Serverless environment.

This plugin adds the ability to declare Fargate-backed ECS tasks which are provisioned during a Serverless deployment.
Taking advantage of Serverless Frameworks ability to build/push images to ECR, you are able to declare both long-running and Lambda-based behaviour side-by-side.

At a high-level the plugin provides the following functionality:

- Allows you to declare service-based (continuous) and scheduled tasks.
- Uses the ECR image support provided within Serverless Framework to help build tasks.
- Maintains an IAM role which honours all managed policies and statements that have been declared within the provider configuration.
- Provides _escape-hatches_ to supply custom configuration such as role ARNs/tags etc.
- Handles both Fargate and Fargate Spot execution environments.

## Example

Below is an example configuration which highlights all possible available options.

```yaml
provider:
  # (required) similar to Lambda-containers, images defined within the provider are available to tasks.
  ecr:
    images:
      my-task:
        path: ./
        file: Dockerfile

  # (optional) role statements present within the provider are added to the task role.
  iamRoleStatements:
    - Effect: Allow
      Action: 'sqs:*'
      Resource: '*'

  # (optional) managed polices present within the provider are added to the task role.

    - Effect: Allow
      Action: 'resource:*'
      Resource: '*'

    # (required) default subnets which are added to tasks that do not contain any overrides; these override any provider-level configuration.
    # all tasks MUST be assigned subnets as Fargate operates within `awsvpc` mode.
    subnetIds:
      - subnet-1234

    # (optional) default flag to assign a public IP to each task, this requires the supplied subnets to be public (internet) facing.
    assignPublicIp: false

  # (optional) additional tags you wish to apply to only Fargate task resources.
  tags:
    name: value

      # (optional) memory you wish to allocate to the given task, defaults to the globally supplied memory value.
      # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#task_size

      # (optional) by default a task is deemed to be a service with a desired count of one,
      # this results in a single long-running process which is a typical use-case of the plugin.
      # however, if you wish to alter this you can include the following configuration options.
      service:
        # (optional) the desired amount of running tasks for the given service.
        desiredCount: 1

        # on-demand Fargate if the spot instance can not be acquired.
        spot: false

      # (optional) schedule expression used to configure the task to be executed at a desired time, as opposed to being a service.
